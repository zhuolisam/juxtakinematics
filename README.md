# Juxtematics

## Overview

Small library designed to facilitate the analysis and computation of kinematic data related to sports movements in a two-dimensional space. 

 <!-- your comment This library is particularly useful for applications involving sports biomechanics, motion analysis, and performance evaluation. -->
Codebase are adopted from [Kinovea](https://github.com/Kinovea/Kinovea) and [kineticstoolkit](https://github.com/kineticstoolkit/kineticstoolkit)
## Features

- **Body Joints Tracking:** Easily input and track the positions of key body joints in a two-dimensional space.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Perform data preprocessing tasks such as interpolation, filtering, and smoothing to enhance the quality of kinematic data.
- **Kinematic Computations:** Compute essential kinematic metrics, including velocities, accelerations, and angles, to gain insights into sports movements.
- **Customizable Processing:** Configure preprocessing and post-calculation options based on your specific analysis requirements.

## Installation

```bash
pip install juxtematics
```
